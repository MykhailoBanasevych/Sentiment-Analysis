,Balatro,positive,"Centuries ago, humanity invented games in the form of cards, dice or just simple little pieces used to represent something else. Ever since then, we built upon that to make them more complex, make more intricate rules, promote competition, even use techonology to increase their complexity to the extent that a human arbiter couldn't be bothered to keep up with. Somewhere among those creations, we lost our way, turning games into intricate skinner boxes with a long list of simulated chores. A series of buttons to press to progress to a predetermined end.  I thank Jim Balatro from returning us to the original form of play. To the drunkards in bars playing dominoes on the table. To the loners playing Solitaire. For instead of using technology to add more layers, to enhancing the core of playing with cards. For stripping us of the layers of vestige and falsehood we've put on play for decades, and laying it bare for us to see it fully for what it truly is. Its true beauty, for all to see.",,210879168,,2025-11-26,,,,,,,

,Balatro,positive,"This game has a lot of universal appeal. Card games are easy and fun, and every system has been fine tuned to addiction perfection. It's very well balanced, and there's enough interesting synergies and random elements to keep runs from feeling identical. Harder difficulties demand attention and respect, and can even be stressful. There are many clever ideas, interaction is kinesthetically satisfying, the singular track is serviceable for the many hours that can disappear into the red, hypnotizing void, and it's impressive how much it does with so little.  It's exactly what it says on the tin, and no more. That this game was nominated for Game of the Year speaks more to what people look for in a video game than any amount of substance Balatro might have. During a time where every big title seems obsessed with stuffing as much needless content and fluff as possible into every endless corner, Roguelike Poker is apparently a radical enough change to become the most popular indie game of 2024.   Balatro is almost [i] immune[/i] to criticism because of its sheer simplicity. It's effectively ""perfect"" in the same way that a bowl of ice cream is perfect; there's not much you can add. You can easily have a few scoops after dinner and be satisfied, whereas a Michelin Star Five Course Meal will naturally have many things you might change to your personal preference (while also demanding more time, money, and just generally being less approachable).   I don't want to downplay the efforts of the creator and the intelligence that went into the design. I read LocalThunk's blogposts and Balatro being as satisfying as it is is not a mistake he slipped into, but the result of years of effort and fine-tuning. He deserves every dollar this game made him. It's ""Video Game Ice Cream"" only in its relative simplicity.  Because of its simplicity, however, Balatro has also drawn some of the most insipid praise I've seen in my life. ""There are no microtransactions."" ""There is no downtime."" ""Watching the number go up is satisfying."" There are MANY interesting things to say about the mechanics and systems, but only at the microscopic level of specific Jokers, Tarots, Planets, Spectrals. The wrapping is Blackjack. You can go play Blackjack with your friends and come away with the same praise. There are no microtransactions, advertisements, or content packs, [i] and[/i] there's a number that goes up. Truly revolutionary stuff.  Is anyone listening? Am I the only one who feels like this game is weirdly terrifying? I can't help but feel existential dread as I watch the score climb up to meaningless amounts, like we've concentrated what makes a video game ""fun"" into a goop that presents itself as numbers and multiplication and pretty colours. Upgrade your chips. Upgrade your mult. Find xMult for later. Find a way to get money. Isn't it satisfying when the burning fire indicates you surpassed the required score long ago? Doesn't that feel good? Doesn't that feel great?  I don't remember anything that happened in this game. I can tell you what the Hanging Chad joker does, I can tell you that Pluto upgrades High Card values, I can tell you that a Straight with an Eight at the bottom is enough to get past the first round, but I can not recall any of the specific minutes that I spent playing on this game.  I guess you're not supposed to. This is a toilet game, a waiting game. It's meant to speed up time, not take up space in the flashback you get on your deathbed. Again, this game is perfect, but that's all it is. A very, very, very, very, very, very, very good version of Candy Crush.   I don't mind its popularity. I think it's great, actually, that so many people like this little indie game, and I wish nothing but the best for the creator, who has taken the opportunity to shout out other lesser-known indie titles. But I also can't understand the awards, the obsessive praise, the people who tell me that this game is insanely great and I just HAVE to try it. Imagine if people recommended ice cream with the same vigor. Like, yeah, I guess it would be weird if you haven't tried it at least once in your life, but where are people getting this passion from? Am I somehow missing some obvious life-changing message within the cards? Or maybe the sheer genius of its game design has gone over my head.   I don't want to play this game ever again, and in writing this review I hope that I can get it out of my head forever.",,210358069,,2025-11-25,,,,,,,

,Balatro,negative,"[b]KAMGUSTA's MINI REVIEW[/b]  The card rogue-lite everyone talks about. I understand why it's so popular, as almost everybody knows how to play cards and make a ""double"", a ""three of a kind"" or a ""flush"". Runs are also quite short and the high randomness makes all of them quite different. As a roguelike and/or deck-building game, it has big flaws: you aren't in full control of your deck (uncertainty and randomness are unavoidable) and the stacking of bonuses ([b]+[/b]chip, [b]+[/b]multi, [b]x[/b]multi) should have been clearer and better balanced. You can get to the point where a single card (a ""high"") scores more than a ""royal flush"", erasing all the fun of a card game. Game also lacks meta-progression, you just unlock more bonuses to be find on your runs. Runs are too short to build your deck or create long-term strategies - you are forced to just hope for good cards and push your luck. Best strategies focus only on gaining a lot of money to be able to reroll and trying to get (pray the RNG God) that couple uber bonuses. For all those reasons, it's not the masterpiece some people talks about and I only recommend it for casual players (in that case, add +2 to the score). It is what it is: a casual, short-lenght, mobile game.  [b]Best played with mouse Recommended buy price: 5$ Score: 5,5/10[/b]",,208965066,,2025-11-11,,,,,,,

It's a fun concept, but by the time you get to the 5th ante or so you have to be scoring 15k chips consistently to actually progress any further. Which is just insane and is reliant on pure luck on what sorts of jokers you picked up along the way.   It's even hard to talk about what is frustrating about this because in order to understand the criticism, you have to have played it.

Trying to figure out how to balance these could be a fun learning curve. Looking at a screen full of numbers I tried mousing over them to see if there was a tool tip explaining when they meant or maybe some in-game help. No such luck. Playing hands blindly for a while I eventually ""won""? I was presented with a screen with an option to ""cash out"". Actually there was no other option. So cashing out is a good thing? Not sure. Next I'm presented with a joker that changes the rules of the game in many different ways, and a different joker-like card that is not a joker that also changes the rules of the game in many ways, and a store where I can buy cards for cash including, for my sins, a loot box. Then I'm presented with three different game modes with no explanation of why I would want to play one over the other. That is a lot of complexity to dump on the player all at once.  Lacking any help or more tutorials I wade into the game without understanding. I play some hands. Some numbers go up. Others go down. I'm not really sure what I should pay attention to. After a while it dawns on me. I have no idea what the goal is. Trying to figure out the byzantine rules and how they combine is slightly fun, but I have no sense of progress and no sense of purpose. The only thing I can tell for sure is when I win a round  I assume eventually I'll reach some sort of major win state, but frankly I lack the patience for it.  This might be a good game, but it needs more comprehensive tutorials and/or in-game help system to help players up the learning curve.",,207956089,,2025-10-30,,,,,,,
,Balatro,negative,"it's a very hard title to really put a thumb on...  At the very core of the game play, this is nearly perfect and too naked at the same time that Balatro felt so brutally straightforward.   It is almost hypocritical to say that you actually miss some extra fluff eg: more animation/mini-games because the game was designed so that you would just get right into it without having to deal with anything else but the bulk of the gameplay which is the strategy, yet, because you literally just grind it out the minute you boot the game up made it felt so much like your 9-5 job that I just can't continue play for too long each session.

,Balatro,negative,Much like my issues with Cloverpit and other luck based games it stops being fun when the game stops allowing you to win. In Cloverpit I gave up after 65 losses in a row. Here it took less because the frustration points are more egregious. Delay between selecting things and the game actually allowing you to play have given me more than enough time to say: I don't recommend this game. I will actively tell people to avoid this game. I actually hope that people making games like this lose their jobs.,,207720136,,2025-10-27,,,,,,,
,Balatro,negative,"It's fun on the first set of difficulties, but eventually it just becomes a tedious exercise of what feels like the game developers actively taunting you with how close you get to the next band before rug-pulling.  Eventually EVERYTHING hinges on you being just lucky enough with just the right set of jokers at just the right stages and it just stops being fun. Especially when what counts for the conditions of a card, i.e. what is considered an enhanced card, seems horribly arbitrary.  Furthermore - the conditions that cause deterioration are badly designed - losing points on Ramen, a multiplying joker that loses .01 of its multiplyer per card discarded, when the Boss Blind is Hook, a joker that discards 2 per hand played - this is ridiculous! The Arm, which takes away a level of a hand played - an utterly unfair Boss Blind that just makes your efforts feel wasted.   The Wall and later Violet Vessel, especially on higher difficulties, are just cruel. Especially as the cards which have a 1 in however much chance of popping clearly don't work properly and need to be fixed. Even when you have the joker which doubles their chances of activating they don't work unless the base chance is a 1 in 2.  I want to like this game, but there are so many aspects that just make me go to the devs ""what do you expect me to do when I'm not being given anything to work with?""",,207688386,,2025-10-27,,,,,,,

,Balatro,negative,"I tried to like this game but honestly it's really annoying with all the ""gotcha"" mechanics they have. Like I don't mind games with luck or variance but this game targets your lack of experience once you develop a feel for how the game is supposed to work.   I've lost to a final boss a few times because  1. They didn't mention wild cards count for debuff blinds  2. That a joker that copies the properties of another one based on position will be deactivated too on a boss blind that disables jokers (which is partially my fault but the annoying thing is they don't tell you that joker order matters and that you can move jokers whenever)  3. The most common, the game picks a boss blind that just shits on your current deck. Like there's an element of randomness but whenever I test a build (for instance going for flushes) the same boss blind comes up over and over again (disable a key suit or unique hands only)  Like I get the appeal of finding synergies and feeling like you busted the game, that parts fun, but the targeted RNG makes it more frustrating than it's worth because once you get the basics (EV, the difference between additive multiplication and true multiplication, the algebra equation that the jokers are) it's a 40 minute minefield of what you don't know and the only lesson I learn is watch out for that particular mechanic next time.",,206883419,,2025-10-16,,,,,,,

Yes, you can get multiplier cards and things to build your deck, but it was still just a card game at the end of the day. I don't understand what people find so addicting about it or anything.

,Balatro,negative,"When I first wrote my review for this game, I complained that you should only buy it if you enjoy gambling already. I want to take that back, but what I won't take back is that I still don't find this game fun. For the majority of my playtime, I was unable to win a single game, but that was because I was using my brain too much. Now that I know how to win, I'm going to explain why I still don't enjoy this game.  The way to win in this game is to spam the same hand over and over and over again. The part where you actually play the game is the part you shouldn't be thinking about at all because you just need to play the same hand you did before. The only part you need to actually think about what hand to play is the very beginning of the game, which is as close to true Poker as Balatro gets. The part of the game where your sense of strategy even matters is in the shop, which I frankly don't find very fun. The shop isn't just where you ""improve your run,"" the shop is so crucial and integral to the flow of this game that you will spend more time there than actually playing with the cards that you'll be buying. It doesn't feel rewarding, it only feels stressful. The game constantly makes you worry about what you should and shouldn't buy, because if you buy what the game deems as ""the wrong thing,"" it can kill your run rounds before you even realize it.  Losing to what feels like one mistake is soul-crushing, and it doesn't give me this yearning to play the game ""one more time."" I just end up feeling defeated, and want to play something else.",,205286470,,2025-09-27,,,,,,,

,Balatro,positive,"Centuries ago, humanity invented games in the form of cards, dice or just simple little pieces used to represent something else. Ever since then, we built upon that to make them more complex, make more intricate rules, promote competition, even use techonology to increase their complexity to the extent that a human arbiter couldn't be bothered to keep up with. Somewhere among those creations, we lost our way, turning games into intricate skinner boxes with a long list of simulated chores. A series of buttons to press to progress to a predetermined end.  I thank Jim Balatro from returning us to the original form of play. To the drunkards in bars playing dominoes on the table. To the loners playing Solitaire. For instead of using technology to add more layers, to enhancing the core of playing with cards. For stripping us of the layers of vestige and falsehood we've put on play for decades, and laying it bare for us to see it fully for what it truly is. Its true beauty, for all to see.",,210879168,,2025-11-26,,,,,,,

,Balatro,positive,"This game has a lot of universal appeal. Card games are easy and fun, and every system has been fine tuned to addiction perfection. It's very well balanced, and there's enough interesting synergies and random elements to keep runs from feeling identical. Harder difficulties demand attention and respect, and can even be stressful. There are many clever ideas, interaction is kinesthetically satisfying, the singular track is serviceable for the many hours that can disappear into the red, hypnotizing void, and it's impressive how much it does with so little.  It's exactly what it says on the tin, and no more. That this game was nominated for Game of the Year speaks more to what people look for in a video game than any amount of substance Balatro might have. During a time where every big title seems obsessed with stuffing as much needless content and fluff as possible into every endless corner, Roguelike Poker is apparently a radical enough change to become the most popular indie game of 2024.   Balatro is almost [i] immune[/i] to criticism because of its sheer simplicity. It's effectively ""perfect"" in the same way that a bowl of ice cream is perfect; there's not much you can add. You can easily have a few scoops after dinner and be satisfied, whereas a Michelin Star Five Course Meal will naturally have many things you might change to your personal preference (while also demanding more time, money, and just generally being less approachable).   I don't want to downplay the efforts of the creator and the intelligence that went into the design. I read LocalThunk's blogposts and Balatro being as satisfying as it is is not a mistake he slipped into, but the result of years of effort and fine-tuning. He deserves every dollar this game made him. It's ""Video Game Ice Cream"" only in its relative simplicity.  Because of its simplicity, however, Balatro has also drawn some of the most insipid praise I've seen in my life. ""There are no microtransactions."" ""There is no downtime."" ""Watching the number go up is satisfying."" There are MANY interesting things to say about the mechanics and systems, but only at the microscopic level of specific Jokers, Tarots, Planets, Spectrals. The wrapping is Blackjack. You can go play Blackjack with your friends and come away with the same praise. There are no microtransactions, advertisements, or content packs, [i] and[/i] there's a number that goes up. Truly revolutionary stuff.  Is anyone listening? Am I the only one who feels like this game is weirdly terrifying? I can't help but feel existential dread as I watch the score climb up to meaningless amounts, like we've concentrated what makes a video game ""fun"" into a goop that presents itself as numbers and multiplication and pretty colours. Upgrade your chips. Upgrade your mult. Find xMult for later. Find a way to get money. Isn't it satisfying when the burning fire indicates you surpassed the required score long ago? Doesn't that feel good? Doesn't that feel great?  I don't remember anything that happened in this game. I can tell you what the Hanging Chad joker does, I can tell you that Pluto upgrades High Card values, I can tell you that a Straight with an Eight at the bottom is enough to get past the first round, but I can not recall any of the specific minutes that I spent playing on this game.  I guess you're not supposed to. This is a toilet game, a waiting game. It's meant to speed up time, not take up space in the flashback you get on your deathbed. Again, this game is perfect, but that's all it is. A very, very, very, very, very, very, very good version of Candy Crush.   I don't mind its popularity. I think it's great, actually, that so many people like this little indie game, and I wish nothing but the best for the creator, who has taken the opportunity to shout out other lesser-known indie titles. But I also can't understand the awards, the obsessive praise, the people who tell me that this game is insanely great and I just HAVE to try it. Imagine if people recommended ice cream with the same vigor. Like, yeah, I guess it would be weird if you haven't tried it at least once in your life, but where are people getting this passion from? Am I somehow missing some obvious life-changing message within the cards? Or maybe the sheer genius of its game design has gone over my head.   I don't want to play this game ever again, and in writing this review I hope that I can get it out of my head forever.",,210358069,,2025-11-25,,,,,,,

,Balatro,negative,"[b]KAMGUSTA's MINI REVIEW[/b]  The card rogue-lite everyone talks about. I understand why it's so popular, as almost everybody knows how to play cards and make a ""double"", a ""three of a kind"" or a ""flush"". Runs are also quite short and the high randomness makes all of them quite different. As a roguelike and/or deck-building game, it has big flaws: you aren't in full control of your deck (uncertainty and randomness are unavoidable) and the stacking of bonuses ([b]+[/b]chip, [b]+[/b]multi, [b]x[/b]multi) should have been clearer and better balanced. You can get to the point where a single card (a ""high"") scores more than a ""royal flush"", erasing all the fun of a card game. Game also lacks meta-progression, you just unlock more bonuses to be find on your runs. Runs are too short to build your deck or create long-term strategies - you are forced to just hope for good cards and push your luck. Best strategies focus only on gaining a lot of money to be able to reroll and trying to get (pray the RNG God) that couple uber bonuses. For all those reasons, it's not the masterpiece some people talks about and I only recommend it for casual players (in that case, add +2 to the score). It is what it is: a casual, short-lenght, mobile game.  [b]Best played with mouse Recommended buy price: 5$ Score: 5,5/10[/b]",,208965066,,2025-11-11,,,,,,,

It's a fun concept, but by the time you get to the 5th ante or so you have to be scoring 15k chips consistently to actually progress any further.

It's even hard to talk about what is frustrating about this because in order to understand the criticism, you have to have played it.

,Balatro,negative,"When I started playing Balatro I was presented with the choice of playing a poker-like hand or exchanging cards. Trying to figure out how to balance these could be a fun learning curve. Looking at a screen full of numbers I tried mousing over them to see if there was a tool tip explaining when they meant or maybe some in-game help. No such luck. Playing hands blindly for a while I eventually ""won""? I was presented with a screen with an option to ""cash out"". Actually there was no other option. So cashing out is a good thing? Not sure. Next I'm presented with a joker that changes the rules of the game in many different ways, and a different joker-like card that is not a joker that also changes the rules of the game in many ways, and a store where I can buy cards for cash including, for my sins, a loot box. Then I'm presented with three different game modes with no explanation of why I would want to play one over the other. That is a lot of complexity to dump on the player all at once.  Lacking any help or more tutorials I wade into the game without understanding. I play some hands. Some numbers go up. Others go down. I'm not really sure what I should pay attention to. After a while it dawns on me. I have no idea what the goal is. Trying to figure out the byzantine rules and how they combine is slightly fun, but I have no sense of progress and no sense of purpose. The only thing I can tell for sure is when I win a round  I assume eventually I'll reach some sort of major win state, but frankly I lack the patience for it.  This might be a good game, but it needs more comprehensive tutorials and/or in-game help system to help players up the learning curve.",,207956089,,2025-10-30,,,,,,,

,Balatro,negative,"It's fun on the first set of difficulties, but eventually it just becomes a tedious exercise of what feels like the game developers actively taunting you with how close you get to the next band before rug-pulling.  Eventually EVERYTHING hinges on you being just lucky enough with just the right set of jokers at just the right stages and it just stops being fun. Especially when what counts for the conditions of a card, i.e. what is considered an enhanced card, seems horribly arbitrary.  Furthermore - the conditions that cause deterioration are badly designed - losing points on Ramen, a multiplying joker that loses .01 of its multiplyer per card discarded, when the Boss Blind is Hook, a joker that discards 2 per hand played - this is ridiculous! The Arm, which takes away a level of a hand played - an utterly unfair Boss Blind that just makes your efforts feel wasted.   The Wall and later Violet Vessel, especially on higher difficulties, are just cruel. Especially as the cards which have a 1 in however much chance of popping clearly don't work properly and need to be fixed. Even when you have the joker which doubles their chances of activating they don't work unless the base chance is a 1 in 2.

,Balatro,negative,"Really fun at low stakes while you're still figuring out how to combine different jokers and cards and unlocking stuff, but then turns into a tedious unfun RNG-fest where you can lose a hundred or so runs in a row just to things entirely out of your control and essentially waste hours of your life which could be spent on something much more productive. Recommend playing until somewhere around Purple stake, after that - either prepare for a boring RNG-slog or go find something more fun to do.",,206986899,,2025-10-18,,,,,,,

,Balatro,negative,"I tried to like this game but honestly it's really annoying with all the ""gotcha"" mechanics they have. Like I don't mind games with luck or variance but this game targets your lack of experience once you develop a feel for how the game is supposed to work.   I've lost to a final boss a few times because  1. They didn't mention wild cards count for debuff blinds  2. That a joker that copies the properties of another one based on position will be deactivated too on a boss blind that disables jokers (which is partially my fault but the annoying thing is they don't tell you that joker order matters and that you can move jokers whenever)  3. The most common, the game picks a boss blind that just shits on your current deck. Like there's an element of randomness but whenever I test a build (for instance going for flushes) the same boss blind comes up over and over again (disable a key suit or unique hands only)  Like I get the appeal of finding synergies and feeling like you busted the game, that parts fun, but the targeted RNG makes it more frustrating than it's worth because once you get the basics (EV, the difference between additive multiplication and true multiplication, the algebra equation that the jokers are) it's a 40 minute minefield of what you don't know and the only lesson I learn is watch out for that particular mechanic next time.",,206883419,,2025-10-16,,,,,,,
,Balatro,negative,"I wish there was a way to write a review without having to recommend it or not. If you love card games and poker and want to play them on a computer, you might love this game. I was hoping that this would be more than that, based on the hype around it, but after playing it, that's pretty much all it was to me. Yes, you can get multiplier cards and things to build your deck, but it was still just a card game at the end of the day. I don't understand what people find so addicting about it or anything. It ended up being as boring as it looked to me.",,206875469,,2025-10-16,,,,,,,

,Balatro,negative,"When I first wrote my review for this game, I complained that you should only buy it if you enjoy gambling already. I want to take that back, but what I won't take back is that I still don't find this game fun. For the majority of my playtime, I was unable to win a single game, but that was because I was using my brain too much. Now that I know how to win, I'm going to explain why I still don't enjoy this game.  The way to win in this game is to spam the same hand over and over and over again. The part where you actually play the game is the part you shouldn't be thinking about at all because you just need to play the same hand you did before. The only part you need to actually think about what hand to play is the very beginning of the game, which is as close to true Poker as Balatro gets. The part of the game where your sense of strategy even matters is in the shop, which I frankly don't find very fun. The shop isn't just where you ""improve your run,"" the shop is so crucial and integral to the flow of this game that you will spend more time there than actually playing with the cards that you'll be buying. It doesn't feel rewarding, it only feels stressful. The game constantly makes you worry about what you should and shouldn't buy, because if you buy what the game deems as ""the wrong thing,"" it can kill your run rounds before you even realize it.  Losing to what feels like one mistake is soul-crushing, and it doesn't give me this yearning to play the game ""one more time."" I just end up feeling defeated, and want to play something else.",,205286470,,2025-09-27,,,,,,,
